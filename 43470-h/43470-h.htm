<p><span class="smcap">Dearest G.</span>,&mdash;I am afraid by this time
you will have seen a good deal in the papers
to cause you alarm, and as it is impossible
to get a letter or telegram through, I will
write you a detailed account of what we
are going through and post it to you at
the first opportunity.</p>

<p>To begin at the beginning, the Sinn
Fein movement, which is now frankly
revolutionary and which must not be
confounded with Redmond's Nationalist
Party, has been in existence for years,
but has always been looked on as a small
body of cranks who were thirsting for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
notoriety. Redmond's policy has always
been to treat them with utter contempt,
and the Government adopted his view.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of war this movement,
encouraged no doubt by German
intrigue and German money, has grown
by leaps and bounds, and about eighteen
months ago a large number broke away
from Redmond's National Volunteers and
formed a volunteer force which they called
the Irish Volunteers. They are frankly
and openly revolutionary, and when it
became known some months ago that they
were obtaining large quantities of arms
and ammunition various persons did all
they could to open the eyes of the authorities
to the dangerous situation that was
growing up. But as the explanation was
always given that the force was for
national defence only, the Government
failed to take any steps to put down the
movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
During the past six months the body has
grown enormously, as many as seven
hundred recruits being enlisted on one
night, and of course doing enormous harm
to recruiting for the Army. On St.
Patrick's Day they held a large review
of several battalions, armed, and the
trams were all held up for about an hour
in College Green. Up to the last moment
there was hope that this would be stopped,
but protests were like a voice crying in
the wilderness. Another time they held
a full dress rehearsal of what has actually
taken place when they "took" the Castle,
St. Stephen's Green, and various buildings.
About a month ago one of their
meetings in the country was broken up
and the two leaders arrested and deported
to England. A huge meeting of protest
was held at the Mansion House, almost
opposite this hotel, and attended by the
Volunteers, all armed, who marched in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
procession. After the meeting they
marched down Grafton Street, singing
"Die Wacht am Rhein" and revolutionary
songs; a slight disturbance with
the police took place and some shots were
fired. People began to ask anxiously
what next? but the Government looked
on and smiled and H. tore his hair.</p>

<p>On Saturday we were going to tea with
friends at Bray, when just as we were
starting H. got an "official" from the
Castle, so I went alone and he went to the
Castle. News had come that a boat had
been taken off the Kerry coast, landing
ammunition, and a very important arrest
had been made. Easter Sunday passed off
in absolute calm, and yesterday (Easter
Monday) morning H. said he had a lot
of letters to write and he would go and
write them at his club, almost next door
to the Sackville Street G.P.O. He found
he wanted to answer some letters that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
were in his desk at the G.P.O., so he walked
over to his room and was just sitting down
when his 'phone went, an urgent message
to go at once to the Castle.</p>

<p>He had only just arrived there, and was
in consultation with Sir M. N., when
suddenly a volley of shots rang out at the
Castle gate, and it was found armed bodies
of men were in possession of the City Hall
and other houses that commanded the
other gates to the Castle, and anyone
attempting to leave the Castle was shot.
All the officials in the Castle were prisoners.</p>

<p>News quickly came that the magazine
in the Park had been taken, the G.P.O.,
two stations, and all the houses that
commanded O'Connell Bridge had been
stormed and taken, and the rebels had
taken St. Stephen's Green, where they were
entrenching themselves.</p>

<p>Meantime, knowing nothing of this,
N. went for a country motor bike ride,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and I did some sewing and wrote letters,
etc., and when N. came in about 12.30 I
said I wanted a walk before lunch and we
would walk down to the club and meet H.
The streets were quiet and deserted till
we crossed O'Connell Bridge, when N.
remarked there was a dense crowd round
Nelson's Pillar, but we supposed it was
a bank holiday crowd waiting for trams.
We were close to the General Post Office
when two or three shots were fired, followed
by a volley, and the crowd began rushing
down towards the bridge, the people calling
out "Go back, go back; the Sinn
Feiners are firing." N. said, "You'd
better go back, Mother; there's going to
be a row; I'll go on to the club and find
Dad"; so I turned and fled with the
crowd and got back safely to the hotel.</p>

<p>Here was excitement and consternation.
Every moment people were coming in with
tales of civilians being shot in the streets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and houses commanding wide thoroughfares
and prominent positions being taken
possession of by the Sinn Feiners, whose
method was to go in detachments of four
or six armed men, ring the bell, and demand
to see the owners of the houses. In many
instances they were away for the Easter
holidays, when the frightened servants
were just turned into the street to go where
they would; but if the master or mistress
were at home they were told with a
revolver at their heads that the house was
required by the Irish Republic for strategic
purposes, and the owners were given the
option of leaving the house or remaining
as prisoners in the basement. A few elected
to do this in preference to leaving all
their household goods to the mercy of
the rebels; but most thought "discretion
the better part of valour" and cleared
out to friends, in some instances only to
be hunted out from their house of refuge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
a second time. The windows of the houses
were then barricaded with a reckless
disregard to valuable furniture, which in
many cases was turned into the street to
form barricades.</p>

<p>You remember my nice housemaid Mary,
gentle as a dove and timid as a hare. I
had got her a very nice place with a lady
who had taken a large house in Leeson
Street close to the bridge and commanding
Fitzwilliam Place. She went this morning
by appointment to meet the lady at the
house and found the Sinn Feiners on the
steps, who pointed their revolvers at her
and told her to clear out. She was so
scared she nearly fell into the area, and
came to the hotel looking like a ghost.</p>

<p>But to return to our own adventures.
Directly I got back to the hotel I rang
up the club and was told by old MacDermott,
the hall-porter, that H. had left
the club at 11.30 to go to the G.P.O.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
saying he would be back shortly; but he
had not returned, and since then the Post
Office had been stormed and the guard
shot or overpowered, and the Sinn Feiners
were in possession of the whole building,
and firing volleys on the police from the
windows! Imagine my feelings!</p>

<p>About 1.30 N. returned, having failed to
find any trace of H., but he had seen some
cavalry shot coming out of Talbot Street
into Sackville Street. The first three or
four were just picked off their horses and
fell wounded or dead, and the horses
were shot. He said the scene of excitement
in Sackville Street was indescribable. We
were just going in to lunch when a telephone
message came through saying H.
was at the Castle but could not leave.</p>

<p>This relieved our minds as to his fate,
and after lunch I was kept busy at the
telephone answering distracted messages
from Post Office officials who were wander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>ing
about looking for H. At about 4 p.m.
N. returned from a tour of inspection, and
told me all was quiet in Sackville Street,
and begged me to go out with him and
see the G.P.O.</p>

<p>I quaked rather, but we set off and
reached Sackville Street safely.</p>

<p>Over the fine building of the G.P.O.
floated a great green flag with the words
"Irish Republic" on it in large white
letters. Every window on the ground
floor was smashed and barricaded with
furniture, and a big placard announced
"The Headquarters of the Provisional
Government of the Irish Republic." At
every window were two men with rifles,
and on the roof the parapet was lined with
men. H.'s room appeared not to have
been touched, and there were no men at
his windows.</p>

<p>We stood opposite and were gazing,
when suddenly two shots were fired, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
seeing there was likely to be an ugly rush,
I fled again, exhorting N. to take refuge
at the club.</p>

<p>He never reached the club, but came
back to the hotel, and we had tea, and he
then went to inspect St. Stephen's Green.</p>

<p>He found all round the Green, just
inside the railings among the shrubberies,
the rebels had dug deep pits or holes, and
in every hole were three men. They had
barricaded the street opposite the Shelbourne
Hotel, and there had been a lot of
firing and several people killed, and shots
had gone into the hotel, which is, as you
know, a fine building facing the Green.</p>

<p>All the evening we heard firing in all
directions of the city and rumours of troops
having arrived from the Curragh. While
at dinner another message came through
from H. to say we were not to be alarmed;
he was quite safe, but might not get home
that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
After dinner N. went out to see if he
could get near the Castle, but he found
awful fighting. The troops were storming
the City Hall and using machine-guns,
and it was too "unhealthy" for him to get
near, so he came back at 9 and went to bed.</p>

<p>I stayed up in case of being wanted on
the 'phone, and at 11.30 p.m. went up to
my room, and a few minutes later H.
walked in, to my immense relief.</p>

<p>The troops had arrived from the Curragh
at about 5 p.m. and had promptly stormed
the City Hall, which commanded the main
gate of the Castle, and had taken it after
fierce fighting.</p>

<p>H. saw prisoners being brought into
the Castle yard, and when all was quiet
he and several other officials crept out and
reached their various homes.</p>

<p>People are appalled at the utter unpreparedness
of the Government. In the face
of a huge body of trained and armed men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
openly revolutionary, they had taken no
precautions whatever for the defence of
the city in the event of an outbreak. At
the beginning of the war H. obtained a
military guard, armed, for the G.P.O.,
and they have always been there. When
the outbreak occurred yesterday the armed
guard were there, but with no ammunition!
The sergeant was wounded in two
places and the rest overpowered.</p>

<p>All night the firing continued. Between
1 and 2 a.m. it was awful, and I lay and
quaked. It was all in the direction of the
Castle.</p>

<p>This morning we hear the military are
pouring into the city, and are in the Shelbourne
Hotel and Trinity College.</p>

<p>The rebels have barricaded Sackville
Street, and it is expected to be very fierce
fighting over the G.P.O. It is terrible!</p>

<p>All our valuables were stored in H.'s
safe and cupboard when we gave up our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
house, and all our dear F.'s books, sword,
and all his possessions, which we value
more than anything else in the world. We
would not trust them with the stored furniture.</p>

<img src="images/i_024.jpg" width="500" height="416" alt="Map, Stephen's Green" />
</div>

<p>Yesterday afternoon the mob broke all
the windows in various streets and looted
all the shops. The streets were strewn with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
clothes, boots, furniture, tram cushions,
and everything you can imagine.</p>

<p>While I am writing now there is incessant
firing in St. Stephen's Green, and we
fear there may be street fighting in this
street.</p>

<p>In case you have forgotten, I will put
a little plan here (see <a href="#stephen">p. 14</a>).</p>


<p class="right1"><i>Tuesday, 5 p.m.</i></p>

<p>This morning martial law was proclaimed
(I will try and get a copy of the
proclamation) at 11.30 and the rebels given
four hours to surrender.</p>

<p>A cruiser and two transports are said
to have arrived at Kingstown, with troops
from England. At 3.30 p.m., as there had
been no surrender, the troops started to
clear St. Stephen's Green, and raked it
with machine-guns from the top of the
Shelbourne Hotel and the United Service
Club. We hear there are many casualties.
N. has just come in, and says a big fire is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
raging in Sackville Street in the shops
opposite the G.P.O., supposed to have been
caused by the mob finding fireworks in a
toy shop. The fire brigade arrived almost
at once and could easily have overcome
the fire, but the brigade was fired on by
the Sinn Feiners, making it impossible for
them to bring the engines into action,
and they had to beat a retreat and leave
the shops to burn themselves out. N.
says the troops are clearing the houses of
rebels behind Dame Street and the region
of the Castle, and there is a lot of firing.
It has turned to rain, which has cleared
the streets of people.</p>

<p>A telegram has just come from the
Admiralty stopping the mail boat from
crossing. No boat has gone to-day, and
we are absolutely cut off.</p>

<p>All the roads leading out of Dublin are
in the hands of the rebels.</p>

<p>H. and N. have just come in, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
seen Dr. W. (now Major W.), Surgeon to
the Forces in Ireland. He told them that
so far we had had about 500 casualties,
two-thirds of them being civilians, shot
in the streets.</p>

<p>The first thing Dr. W. heard of the outbreak
was a 'phone message telling him to
go at once to the Shelbourne as a man
had been shot. He supposed it was a case
of suicide, so jumped into his car and
went off, fortunately in mufti. In Nassau
Street his car was stopped and he was
ordered to get out by rebels. He attempted
to argue, and was told if he did not obey
instantly he would be shot. Had he been
in uniform he would have been shot at
sight. As a civilian doctor they allowed
him to go, and he took his bag and ran.
He found three men shot in the Shelbourne,
and a boy was shot as he reached the
door.</p>


<p class="right1">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
<i>Wednesday, April 26th, 9.30 a.m.</i></p>

<p>Last evening was quiet till we went to
bed at 10.30, when almost immediately
a furious machine-gun fire began. It
seemed just at the back of the hotel, but
was really at the top of Grafton Street
and the street leading to Mercer's Hospital.
It lasted about twenty minutes, and then
almost immediately after we got into bed
a 'phone came that H. was to go at once
to the Vice-Regal Lodge in the Ph&oelig;nix
Park, so he dressed and tried every way to
get a motor; but of course no motor would
go out. After some delay he got the field
ambulance of the fire brigade at Dr. W.'s
suggestion; but when it came the men
told H. they had been carrying wounded
all day, and that they had been constantly
stopped by pickets and the car searched,
and if they went and the car was stopped
and found to contain H. they would
undoubtedly all be shot; so H. considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
it too risky, and it had to be abandoned.
Eventually his Excellency gave his instructions
over the 'phone, first in French,
but that particular 'phone either did not
speak or did not understand French, so
eventually he took the risk of the 'phone
being tapped and gave them in English.
At last H. got to bed about 1 a.m., to be
at the 'phone again at 5 a.m.</p>

<p>While we were dressing a terrific bombardment
with field guns began&mdash;the first
we had heard&mdash;and gave me cold shivers.
The sound seemed to come from the direction
of the G.P.O., and we concluded they
were bombarding it. It went on for a
quarter of an hour&mdash;awful! big guns and
machine-guns&mdash;and then ceased, but we
hear they were bombarding Liberty Hall,
the headquarters of Larkin and the
strikers two years ago, and always a nest
of sedition. It is now crammed with Sinn
Feiners. The guns were on H.M.S. <i>Helga</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
that came up the river and smashed it
from within about three hundred yards.
It made me feel quite sick.</p>

<p>We think that they are leaving the Post
Office for a time with the hope that when
other strongholds are taken the Republican
Government will surrender. H. has just
been summoned to the Castle, and there is
no knowing when he will be back. All
who go out carry their lives in their hands.
I went out twice yesterday, but we were
turned back by shots being fired from
upper windows, and the Lord Lieutenant
has issued a proclamation begging people
to keep in their houses, so I must restrain
my curiosity.</p>

<p>All the shops remain closed, and no
papers are issued except the proclamation,
and we know nothing of what is going on
in other parts of Ireland. But there are
wild rumours of insurrection in Cork and
other places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
This morning there is firing again in St.
Stephen's Green, so the rebels are still
there.</p>

<p>N. did a very fine thing yesterday.
After the Green had been raked by our
machine-gun fire he strolled up, in his
casual way, to see the result! In front of
one of the side gates in the railings, which
are seven feet high and spiked three ways,
he saw a small group of men peering into
the Green. He went to see what they
were looking at. The rebels had barricaded
the gate, which opened inwards, by putting
one of the heavy garden seats against it
<i>upside down</i>and on the top of it another
<i>right side up</i>, and lying full length on
the seat, face downwards, was a man, a
civilian, with all his lower jaw blown away
and bleeding profusely. N. immediately
climbed the railings and dropped down on
the Sinn Fein side and found that the man
was still living; he then turned and fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
cursed the men who were looking on, and
asked if there was not one man enough
to come over the railings and help him.
Whereupon three men climbed over and
together they lifted down the seat with the
poor creature on it, dragged away the
other seat, when they were able to open
the gate, and then brought out the seat
and the man on it and carried him to the
nearest hospital, where he died in about
five minutes.</p>

<p>N.'s theory is he was probably one of
the civilians taken prisoner by the Sinn
Fein the previous day, and was trying to
escape from the awful machine-gun fire
when he was shot down and fell back on to
the seat. It was a terrible case.</p>

<p>The rebels from St. Stephen's Green are
now also in possession of the College of
Surgeons and are firing across the Green at
the troops in the Shelbourne Hotel.</p>

<p>Lord S. tells me that 30,000 troops were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
landed at Kingstown this morning, and
we hear they are amazed at their reception,
as they had been told that they were going
to quell a rebellion in Ireland, and lo!
on their arrival at Kingstown the whole
population turned out to cheer them,
giving them food, cigarettes, chocolate,
and everything the hospitable inhabitants
could provide, so that the puzzled troops
asked plaintively: "Who then are we
going to fight, and where is the rebellion?"
However, they were quickly disillusioned,
for in marching into Dublin, when they
reached Ballsbridge they came within
range of several houses occupied by Sinn
Feiners, and without a word of warning
the battalion of Sherwood Foresters came
under terrible cross-fire and were just
shot down, unable to return a single shot.
I have not heard how many casualties
occurred, but two or three officers and
many men were killed and a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
wounded. So surely soon we must be
relieved.</p>


<p class="right1"><i>Thursday, April 27th.</i></p>

<p>Last night the mail boat left carrying
passengers, and if it goes this evening Lord
S. may be crossing, and he will take this
to you.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon and evening there
was terrible fighting. The rebels hold all
the bridges over the canal, one on the tram
line between this and Blackrock, another
at the end of Baggot Street, and the other
at Leeson Street. The fighting was terrible,
but in the end we took the Leeson Street
bridge, and I hope still hold it, as this
opens a road to Kingstown. We failed to
take the other two.</p>

<p>At the end of Lower Mount Street the
rebels held the schools, and there was
fierce fighting: our troops failed to surround
the schools, and in the end, when
they at last took them by a frontal attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
with the loss of eighteen men and one
officer, only one rebel was taken, the rest
having escaped by the back.</p>

<p>Yesterday, to our great indignation, the
public-houses were allowed to be open from
2 till 5, though every shop, bank, and
public building was closed&mdash;just to inflame
the mob, it could not have been on
any other grounds; and yet at 8 p.m.,
after being on duty from 5 a.m., H. could
not get a whiskey and soda, or even a
glass of cider with his dinner, as it was
out of hours. I was <i>furious</i>!</p>

<p>I must close this, as Lord S. has come in
and says he expects to go to-night and will
take this and H.'s report, so I will start a
fresh letter to-morrow.</p>

<div class="nobreak">

<p>Don't worry overmuch about us. We
quite expect to come out of this, but if
we don't N. is <i>yours</i>.</p>

<p class="right">L. N.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
<a name="second" id="second"><span class="smcap">Second Letter.</span></a></h2>


<p class="right1"><i>Friday, 10 a.m.</i></p>

<p>Dearest G.,&mdash;After all my letter did
not get off last night, as the roads were
too dangerous to admit of Dr. W. motoring
Lord S. to Kingstown. He got a permit
to pass our troops, but there were too
many Sinn Fein positions and snipers to
make it possible for them to pass through.</p>

<p>If the position improves, he will go to-night,
so I may be able to send this too,
if I can write enough to make it worth
while, but I am still rather shaky from a
fright I had last night.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning the Red Cross ambulance
sent in to the hotel to ask for volunteer
workers to act as stretcher-bearers
and do all sorts of jobs connected with the
Red Cross, and N. and several men staying
in the hotel volunteered. I was glad
he should, as he is of course safer attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to the Red Cross than roaming the streets
making rescues on his own, and if he was
killed or wounded we should at least hear
of it. But the risks are many and great,
as in this kind of street fighting, where all
the firing is from windows or from housetops,
the ambulance are frequently under
fire.</p>

<p>However, N. having volunteered
promptly went off, and we saw him no
more. While we were having dinner
Mr. O'B., who had been out all day with
the ambulance, was dining with us. H.
was called to the telephone to receive this
message: "You must not expect to see
or hear from me till this is over."</p>

<p>H. asked who the message was from,
and the answer came back: "Your son"
in a voice that H. was sure was not N.'s.
H. then asked where the message came
from, and was told "The Castle."</p>

<p>He returned to us greatly perturbed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and we held a consultation. We all
agreed there was only one interpretation
to be put on it, viz., that N. had been
taken prisoner by the rebels, and that
someone who was well disposed to H. had
taken this opportunity of letting him know,
and that saying the message came from
the Castle was just a blind. H. rang up
the head of the Red Cross, and he told
us only two of the Red Cross volunteers
were missing who had been out that day,
and both of them were known, and N.
was not one of them, so we were still more
mystified.</p>

<p>It then occurred to H. that it might be
possible to trace back the message and find
out where it really had been sent from,
so he called up the exchange, and after
a little delay he heard the message had
actually been sent from the Castle and by
N., who was there.</p>

<p>Imagine our relief! though still com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>pletely
in the dark as to why the boy had
not come back like other workers, and
why we were not to expect to see him
again.</p>

<p>Next morning in walked the truant, not
best pleased that we had been inquiring
for him. His explanation was quite simple.
He had been attached to a branch of the
ambulance that had its depôt at the
Castle, so worked from there and returned
to the Castle at night. Hearing this, and
not knowing in the least to what part of
the city his work would take him, and the
impossibility of sending any message or
note to tell us where he was, and knowing
how anxious I should be if he did not
return, he asked the Castle authorities if
he might send a message to <i>relieve our
minds</i>! He was told he might do so,
but it must only be one sentence, and he
must have the censor in the box with him.
This so flustered N. that he could think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
nothing to say but the words I have quoted;
they seemed to him to express the position
exactly, and he never dreamt of the
interpretation we should put on them.
As it was I spent an hour I don't ever like
to remember and which unnerved me more
than I thought possible, and all I got was
a trouncing from N. for being so "nervy."
Surely much is expected from mothers
these days!</p>

<p>The volunteer workers, among other
things, enter houses where there are known
to be wounded Sinn Feiners and bring
them out and take them to hospitals.</p>

<p>This N. was doing yesterday. One of
the most awful things in this terrible
time is that there must be scores of dead
and dying Sinn Feiners, many of them
mere lads, that no one can get at in the
houses, and where they will remain till
after the rebellion; and in some cases the
houses take fire and they are all burnt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
However, whatever is possible is being
done.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the worst day we have
had, as there was desperate fighting in
Grafton Street, just at our back, and the
side streets; and several volleys in our
street.</p>

<p>In the morning I was sitting on a settee
near the window of the lounge, knitting
and looking out and listening to the firing
in Grafton Street, when shots were fired
just outside our windows, and Mr. B., the
manager, came in and said, "We must
shut all the shutters, Mrs. N., it is getting
a bit too hot, and I am taking no risks."
So all the shutters were closed, and I
moved to the drawing-room above, which
also overlooks the street.</p>

<p>All the afternoon an awful battle raged
in the neighbourhood of the river and
quays, and the din of the great guns and
machine-guns was tremendous. We now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
have 30,000 troops and plenty of artillery
and machine-guns, so the result cannot be
uncertain, though there is desperate work
to be done before the end is in sight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_042.jpg" width="500" height="351" alt="Troops formed a semi-circle around the G.P.O." />
</div>

<p>The troops are said to have formed
a huge semi-circle with the G.P.O. as the
centre, and, starting from the river, are
driving the rebels back street by street, till
eventually they will be in a small enclosure,
when they will bombard it to pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
The G.P.O. has such valuable records,
etc., and the contents of the safes are so
precious, that they will not raze it to the
ground if they can help it; but it has so
much subterranean space, that would afford
cover to thousands of Sinn Feiners, that
we hear they are going to fire some "gas"
shells into it and then rush it!</p>

<p>Up to yesterday afternoon they had got
to Abbey Street on the right, and no doubt
were closing in equally on other sides. The
shells had started several fires; nearly all the
shops on the quay on the side of the Custom
House were burning yesterday afternoon,
and later in the evening many others
broke out.</p>

<p>I cannot give you any idea of what it
was like when I went to bed. I sent for
Mrs. B., the manager's wife, such a splendid
little woman, and together we watched
it from my window, which is high up and
looked in the right direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
It was the most awe-inspiring sight I
have ever seen. It seemed as if the whole
city was on fire, the glow extending right
across the heavens, and the red glare
hundreds of feet high, while above the roar
of the fires the whole air seemed vibrating
with the noise of the great guns and
machine-guns. It was an inferno! We
remained spell-bound, and I can't tell
you how I longed for you to see it. We
had only just come down from the window&mdash;we
had been standing on the window
ledge leaning out&mdash;when H. came and told
us no one was to look out of the windows
as there was cross-firing from the United
Service Club and another building, and
Mr. O'B., who was watching the fires
from his window, had a bullet a few inches
from his head!!</p>

<p>About 2 a.m. I woke to find the room
illuminated in spite of dark blinds and
curtains, and I rushed to the window and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
saw an enormous fire; it seemed to be in
the direction of the Four Courts, which is
in the hands of the Sinn Feiners, and we
hear this morning that a portion of the
buildings was burnt last night.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>
This was incorrect; it was the Linen Hall
barracks that were burnt.</p></div>

<p>Yesterday Lord S. had a narrow escape
from a sniper who has been worrying this
street for two days and could not be
located. He was picking off soldiers during
the fighting in Grafton Street, but later
turned his attention to the cross streets
between this and Grafton Street, and there
as nearly as possible got Lord S., who
was coming back to us from the Castle.</p>

<p>The military thought the man was on
<i>our</i> roof, which made us all bristle with
indignation&mdash;the mere idea of the wretch
being on our hotel; but a thorough search
proved he was not here, though he evidently
had access to <i>some</i> roof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
In this respect we are much better off
than our friends the V.'s. They came into
their town house only about a month
ago, and being in Upper Mount Street it
was in one of the most active haunts of
the snipers. They had several on their
roof, and when they went up to bed
at night they could hear the snipers walking
about and talking on the roof. Does
it not make one creep to think of it?
Mr. V. had his bed put on the upper landing
exactly under the trap-door on to the
roof, so that had the rebels attempted
to enter the house at night they would have
come down "plop" on to him in his bed.
He surrounded himself with all the arms
he could muster, and the wretched Mrs. V.
lay in bed and quaked, expecting any
minute to hear a battle royal raging outside
her bedroom door. In this street an
old lady of seventy-three was shot through
the leg in her own room, and was taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to Dr. W.'s home, where she had to have
her leg amputated; and in another house
a servant flashed on her electric light when
going to bed and was instantly shot
through the head! Our friend Miss K.
also had a narrow escape. She had only
just left her drawing-room, when a bullet
passed straight through the room and
buried itself in a picture.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, when the firing in
Grafton Street was over, the mob appeared
and looted the shops, clearing the great
provision shops and others. From the
back of this hotel you look down on an
alley that connects with Grafton Street,&mdash;and
at the corner, the shop front in Grafton
Street, but with a side entrance into this
lane, is a very large and high-class fruiterer.
From the windows we watched the proceedings,
and I never saw anything so
brazen! The mob were chiefly women and
children, with a sprinkling of men. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
swarmed in and out of the side door bearing
huge consignments of bananas, the
great bunches on the stalk, to which the
children attached a cord and ran away
dragging it along. Other boys had big
orange boxes which they filled with tinned
and bottled fruits. Women with their
skirts held up received showers of apples
and oranges and all kinds of fruit which
were thrown from the upper windows by
their pals; and ankle-deep on the ground
lay all the pink and white and silver
paper and paper shavings used for packing
choice fruits. It was an amazing sight,
and nothing daunted these people. Higher
up at another shop we were told a woman
was hanging out of a window dropping
down loot to a friend, when she was shot
through the head by a sniper, probably our
man; the body dropped into the street
and the mob cleared. In a few minutes
a hand-cart appeared and gathered up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
body, and instantly all the mob swarmed
back to continue the joyful proceedings!</p>

<p>H. and Lord S. were sitting at the window
for a few minutes yesterday when the fruit
shop was being looted, and saw one of the
funniest sights they had ever seen. A
very fat, very blousy old woman emerged
from the side street and staggered on to
the pavement laden with far more loot
than she could carry. In her arms she had
an orange box full of fruit, and under her
shawl she had a great bundle tied up which
kept slipping down. Having reached the
pavement, she put down her box and sat
on it, and from her bundle rolled forth
many tins of fruit. These she surveyed
ruefully, calling on the Almighty and all
the saints to help her!! From these she
solemnly made her selection, which she
bound up in her bundle and hoisted, with
many groans and lamentations, on her
back and made off with, casting back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
many longing looks at the pile of things
left on the pavement, which were speedily
disposed of by small boys.</p>

<p>On Wednesday when the looting was
going on in Sackville Street a fine, large
boot shop was receiving attention from
swarms of looters. Ragged women and
children were seen calmly sitting in the
window trying on boots and shoes, and
one old woman with an eye to future needs
made up a bundle of assorted sizes and tied
them up in her apron. She had only
reached the pavement, when she bethought
her to leave her bundle in a corner and
return for a further consignment which
she tied up in her shawl. On returning
to the street great was her rage and
indignation on finding the original bundle
had disappeared. Then were there sore
lamentations and violent abuse of the
police, who could not even "protect the
property of a poor old woman."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
In Sackville Street was a very large shop
called Clery's; for some reason the looters
were afraid to start on it, and old women
passed up and down gazing longingly at
fur coats and silken raiment and saying
sorrowfully, "Isn't Clery's broke yet?"
and "Isn't it a great shame that Clery's
is not broke!" Humour and tragedy
are so intermixed in this catastrophe.
A very delicate elderly lady who is staying
here said to me this morning, in answer
to my inquiry as to how she had slept:
"I could not sleep at all. When the guns
ceased the <i>awful silence</i> made me so nervous!"
I know exactly what she meant.
When the roar of the guns ceases you can
<i>feel</i> the silence.</p>


<p class="right1"><i>4 p.m.</i></p>

<p>When I had got so far this morning I
got an urgent message from the Red Cross
asking me to make more armlets for the
workers. With two other ladies I had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
making them yesterday, so I collected
my helpers and we worked till lunch, when
another request came that we would make
four large Red Cross flags, as they were
going to try to bury some of the dead
and needed the flags for the protection of
the parties. We have just finished them,
and are wondering what will be the next
call. It is such a good thing I have my
sewing-machine here.</p>

<p>On Wednesday evening Lord S. was at
Mercer's Hospital with a doctor when
eleven dead were brought in, and a priest
brought in a rifle he had taken from a dead
Sinn Feiner. It had an inscription in
German and the name of the factory in
Berlin, which Lord S. copied. It is
believed that nearly all the arms and
ammunition are of German make, and it
is said that the cruiser that was sunk on
Saturday was bringing heavy guns and
forty officers, but I don't know if there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
any truth in that. The opinion is very
strong that the Sinn Feiners were led to
believe that they would have great German
reinforcements, and that all they had to
do was to hold the troops here for a couple
of days while the Germans landed a big
force on the west coast of Ireland. We
also hear that Sir R. Casement has been
shot in London, but you probably know
a great deal more about that than I do,
as we see no papers and are completely
cut off from all news.</p>

<p>On Wednesday three of the ringleaders
were caught, and it is said they were shot
immediately! It is also believed that
Larkin was shot on the top of a house in
St. Stephen's Green, but as the rebels
still hold the house it has not been possible
to identify him, but he is said to have been
here on Monday.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> This was incorrect; it appears Larkin was
not in Dublin.</p>
</div>


<p class="right1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
<i>5 p.m.</i></p>

<p>Colonel C. has just come in, having been
in the thick of it for forty-eight hours.
He tells us the Post Office has been set
on fire by the Sinn Feiners, who have left
it. If this is true, and it probably is, I
fear we have lost all our valuable possessions,
including my diamond pendant,
which was in my jewel-case in H.'s safe.</p>

<p>To-day about lunch-time a horrid
machine-gun suddenly gave voice very
near us. We thought it was in this street,
but it may have been in Kildare Street;
also the sniper reappeared on the roofs,
and this afternoon was opposite my bedroom
window judging from the sound.
I pulled down my blinds. A man might
hide for weeks on the roofs of these houses
among the chimney stacks and never be
found as long as he had access to some
house for food. When we were working
in my room this afternoon he fired some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
shots that could not have been more
than twenty yards away.</p>

<p>The serious problem of food is looming
rather near, as nothing has come into the
city since Saturday. Boland's bakery,
an enormous building, is in the hands of
the rebels, who have barricaded all the
windows with sacks of flour, and it is said
it will have to be blown up. There is
not a chance of getting them out in any
other way. The rebels also have Jacob's
biscuit factory, where there are still huge
stores of flour. Every prominent building
and every strategic position was taken
before the authorities at the Castle woke
to the fact that there was a rebellion!</p>

<p>I was almost forgetting to tell you
how splendidly one of H.'s men behaved
when the G.P.O. was taken. When the
rebels took possession they demanded the
keys from the man who had them in
charge. He quietly handed over the keys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
having first abstracted the keys of H.'s
room!</p>

<p>Imagine such self-possession at such a
terrible moment.</p>

<p>A young man has come to stay in the
hotel who saw the taking of the G.P.O.
He was staying at the hotel exactly opposite
the building and went into the G.P.O.
to get some stamps. As he was leaving
the office a detachment of about fifteen
Irish Volunteers marched up and formed
up in front of the great entrance. He
looked at them with some curiosity,
supposing they were going to hold a
parade; two more detachments arrived,
and immediately the word of command was
given, and they rushed in through the door.
Shots were fired inside the building, and,
as the young man said, he "hooked it"
back to the hotel, which was one of those
burnt a few days later. The whole thing
occupied only a few moments, as, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Bank Holiday, there was only a small
staff in the building.</p>


<p class="right1"><i>6.30 p.m.</i>
A party of soldiers and a young officer
have just arrived to search the roof for
the sniper. They say he is on the roof
of the annexe, which is connected with
the main building by covered-in bridges.
They are now on the roof and shots are
being fired, so I expect they have spotted
him.</p>

<p>When N. was out last night another
ambulance had a bad experience. They
had fetched three wounded Sinn Feiners
out of a house, and were taking them to
hospital, when they came under heavy
fire. The driver was killed, so the man
beside him took the wheel and was
promptly wounded in both legs. The car
then ran away and wrecked itself on a
lamp post. Another ambulance had to
run the gauntlet and go to the rescue!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
On the whole as far as possible the rebels
have respected the Red Cross, but not the
white flag. In house-to-house fighting
there can be no connected action, and
yesterday when a house was being stormed
the rebels hung out a white flag, and
when the troops advanced to take them
prisoners they were shot down from a
house a few doors higher up the street,
so now no more white flag signals are to
be recognised. If they want to surrender
they must come out and take their own
risks.</p>

<p>We asked N. if he knew what had
happened to the ambulance that had two
men missing yesterday, and he told us
they were in the act of entering a Sinn
Fein house to bring out wounded with
two other men when the ambulance came
under such heavy fire that, as it contained
one or two other wounded men, it had to
beat a retreat and moved off. Two of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
volunteer helpers ran after it and succeeded
in reaching it and climbed in, but
the other two took refuge in the area,
and N. did not know how or when they
were rescued. This is an instance of the
extreme danger that attends the ambulance
work. The marvel is that the casualties
are so few.</p>

<p>Guinness's Brewery have made three
splendid armoured cars by putting great
long boilers six feet in diameter on to their
large motor lorries. Holes are bored down
the sides to let in air, and they are painted
grey. The driver sits inside too. They
each carry twenty-two men or a ton of
food in absolute security. N. saw them
at the Castle being packed with men;
nineteen got in packed like herrings, and
three remained outside. Up came the
sergeant: "Now then, gentlemen, move
up, move up: the car held twenty-two
yesterday; it must hold twenty-two to-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>day";
and in the unfortunate three were
stuffed. It must have been suffocating,
but they were taken to their positions in
absolute safety.</p>


<p class="right1"><i>Saturday, 29th, 10 a.m.</i></p>

<p>Last night was an agitating one. The
sniper was very active, and after dinner
several shots struck the annexe, one or
two coming through the windows, and one
broke the glass roof of the bridge. Mr. B.,
who never loses his head, decided to get
all the people out of the annexe, with
staff (about forty people); and all we in
the main building, whose rooms look out
on the back, were forbidden to have lights
in our rooms at all. There was such a
strong feeling of uneasiness throughout the
hotel, and always the danger of its being
set on fire, that about 10 p.m. H. said
we must be prepared at any moment to
leave the hotel if necessary. So we went
up to our room and in pitch darkness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
groped about and collected a few things
(F.'s miniature and the presentation portrait
of him, my despatch case with his
letters, my fur coat, hat and boots),
and we took them down to the sitting-room,
which H. uses as an office, on the
first floor. All the people in the hotel
were collected in the lounge, which is
very large and faces the street, and the
whole of the back was in complete darkness.
The firing quieted down, and about
11.30 we crept up to our room and lay
down in our clothes. When dawn broke
I got up and undressed and had two
hours' sleep. All the rest of the guests
spent the night in the lounge.</p>

<p>This morning we hear an officer has been
to say that the shots fired into the hotel
last night were fired by the military.
People were constantly pulling up their
blinds for a moment with the lights on to
look at the city on fire, and the military have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
orders to fire on anything that resembles
signalling without asking questions.</p>

<p>Reliable news has come in this morning
that nothing remains of the G.P.O. but
the four main walls and the great portico.
It is absolutely burnt out. The fires last
night were terrible, but we dared not look
out. Eason's Library and all the shops
and buildings between O'Connell Bridge
and the G.P.O. on both sides of Sackville
Street are gone.</p>

<p>It is difficult to think of the position
without intense bitterness, though God
knows it is the last thing one wishes for
at such a time. In pandering to Sir E.
Carson's fanaticism and allowing him to
raise a body of 100,000 armed men for the
sole purpose of rebellion and provisional
government the Government tied their own
hands and rendered it extremely difficult
to stop the arming of another body of
men, known to be disloyal, but whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
<i>avowed</i> reason was the internal defence of
Ireland! In Ulster the wind was sown,
and, my God, we have reaped the whirlwind!</p>

<p>We hear that many of our wounded are
being sent to Belfast, as the hospitals
here are crowded, and the food problem
must soon become acute. Mr. O'B. told
me his ambulance picked up four wounded,
three men and a woman, and took them
to the nearest hospital. The woman was
dying, so they stopped at a church and
picked up a priest; arrived at the hospital
the authorities said they could not
possibly take them in as they had not
enough food for those they had already
taken, but when they saw the condition
of the woman they took her in to die, and
the others had to be taken elsewhere.</p>

<p>If the main walls of the G.P.O. remain
standing it may be we shall find the safe
in H.'s room still intact. It was built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
into the wall, and my jewel-case was in
it, but all our silver, old engravings, and
other valuables were stored in the great
mahogany cupboards when we gave up
our house in the autumn, as being the
safest place in Dublin.</p>


<p class="right1"><i>4 p.m.</i></p>

<p>Sir M. N. has just rung up to say the
rebels have surrendered unconditionally.
We have no details, and the firing continues
in various parts of the town. But if the
leaders have surrendered it can only be a
question of a few hours before peace is
restored, and we can go forth and look on
the wreck and desolation of this great city.</p>

<div class="nobreak">

<p>So ends, we hope, this appalling chapter
in the history of Ireland&mdash;days of horror
and slaughter comparable only to the
Indian Mutiny. This seems a suitable
place, dear G., to end this letter, and I
hope to start a happier one to-morrow.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
<a name="third" id="third"><span class="smcap">Third Letter</span></a></h2>


<p class="right1"><i>Sunday, April 30th, 10 a.m.</i></p>

<p>Dearest G.,&mdash;When I closed my letter
last night with the news that the rebel
leaders had surrendered I hoped to start
this new letter in a more cheerful strain;
but while we were dining last night H.
was rung up from the Castle to hear that
the whole of Sackville Street north of the
G.P.O. right up to the Rotunda was on
fire and blazing so furiously that the fire
brigade were powerless; nothing could
go near such an inferno. There was
nothing to be done but let the fire exhaust
itself.</p>

<p>If this was true, it involved the loss of
the Post Office Accountant's Office opposite
the G.P.O., the Sackville Street Club,
Gresham and Imperial Hotels, and other
important buildings, and would have
increased H.'s difficulties enormously, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
it would have been necessary to build up
the Post Office organisation again, with
no records, registers, accounts, or documents
of any kind&mdash;at best a stupendous
task. However, fortunately this morning
we hear the reports were exaggerated.
The Imperial Hotel, Clery's great shop,
and one or two others were burnt, but the
upper part of the street escaped, and the
Accountant's Office and the Sackville
Street Club were not touched.</p>

<p>This morning Mr. C, who has been H.'s
great support all through this trying time
(his second in command being away ill),
and several other members of the staff
are coming here, and with H. they are
going down to see what remains of the
G.P.O. It is being guarded from looters,
as, from the enormous number of telegraph
instruments destroyed, there must be a
large quantity of copper and other metal,&mdash;a
very valuable asset,&mdash;and also several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
thousand pounds in cash for payment of
staff and soldiers' dependants, besides heaps
of other valuable property.</p>

<p>Here I must tell you how absolutely
heroic the telephone staff have been at the
Exchange. It is in a building a considerable
distance from the G.P.O., and the
Sinn Feiners have made great efforts to
capture it. The girls have been surrounded
by firing; shots have several times come
into the switch-room, where the men
took down the boards from the back of
the switch-boards and arranged them as
shelters over the girls' heads to protect
them from bullets and broken glass. Eight
snipers have been shot on buildings commanding
the Exchange, and one of the
guard was killed yesterday; and these
twenty girls have never failed. They have
been on duty since Tuesday, sleeping
when possible in a cellar and with indifferent
food, and have cheerfully and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
devotedly stuck to their post, doing the
work of forty. Only those on duty on
the outbreak of the rebellion could remain;
those in their homes could never get back,
so with the aid of the men who take the
night duty these girls have kept the whole
service going. All telegrams have had to
be sent by 'phone as far as the railway
termini, and they have simply saved the
situation. It has been magnificent!</p>

<p>The shooting is by no means over, as
many of the Sinn Fein strongholds refuse
to surrender. Jacob's biscuit factory is
very strongly held, and when the rebels
were called on to surrender they refused
unless they were allowed to march out
carrying their arms!</p>


<div class="nobreak">

<blockquote>
<p class="mb0">As the book passes through the press, I learn on the
one unimpeachable authority that the story about Messrs.
Jacob &amp; Co., however picturesque, is purely apocryphal.</p>

<p class="right mt0 mb0">M.L.N.</p>

<p class="noi mt0"><span class="smcap">The Sinn Fein Rebellion as I saw it</span>, page 59.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>It is said that when Jacob was told that
the military might have to blow up the
factory he replied: "They may blow it to
blazes for all I care; I shall never make
another biscuit in Ireland." I don't know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
if this is true, but it very well may be, for
he has been one of the model employers in
Dublin, and almost gave up the factory
at the time of the Larkin strike, and only
continued it for the sake of his people;
and so it will be with the few great industries
in the city. Dublin is ruined.</p>

<p>Yesterday I made a joyful discovery.
When we came back from Italy in March,
H. brought back from the office my large
despatch-case in which I keep all F.'s
letters. I did not remember what else
was in it, so I investigated and found my
necklet with jewelled cross and the pink
topaz set (both of these being in large
cases would not go in the jewel-case),
also the large old paste buckle; so I am
not absolutely destitute of jewellery. But,
best of all, there were the three little
handkerchiefs F. sent me from Armentières
with my initial worked on them;
for these I was grieving more than for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
anything, and when I found them the
relief was so great I sat with them in my
hand and cried.</p>

<p>This week has been a wonderful week
for N. Never before has a boy of just
seventeen had such an experience. Yesterday
morning he was at the Automobile
Club filling cans of petrol from casks for
the Red Cross ambulance. He came in to
lunch reeking of petrol. In the afternoon
he went round with the Lord Mayor in
an ambulance collecting food for forty
starving refugees from the burnt-out
district housed in the Mansion House, and
after tea went out for wounded and
brought in an old man of seventy-eight
shot through the body. He was quite
cheery over it, and asked N. if he thought
he would recover. "Good Lord! yes;
why not?" said N., and bucked the
old man up!</p>

<p>Some of the staff who came here this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
morning had seen a copy of the <i>Daily
Mail</i> yesterday, which devoted about
six lines to the condition of things in Ireland
and spoke of a Sinn Fein riot in which
four soldiers and about six rebels had been
killed. If that is all the English people
are being told of a rebellion which 30,000
troops and many batteries of artillery are
engaged in putting down, my letter will be
rather a surprise to you; and as the news
must come out, the English people will
hardly be pleased at being kept in the dark.
Such a rebellion cannot be suppressed like
a Zeppelin raid. During the first three
days our casualties were nearly 1,000; now
we hear they are close on 2,000.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> This was exaggerated, our total casualties
being about 1,380.</p></div>

<p>The College of Surgeons in St. Stephen's
Green is still held by the rebels, so the
firing of machine-guns from the Shelbourne
Hotel and the United Service Club goes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>on as before, and there is intermittent
firing in all directions. I doubt if it will
quite cease for some days, as these strongholds
will not surrender. Also the incendiary
fires will probably continue. The
great fire in Sackville Street last night was
no doubt the work of incendiaries, as all
the fires had died down. There was no
wind, no shells were being fired, and no
reason for the outbreak, but with all the
relations and sympathisers of the rebels at
large the fires may very well continue.</p>

<p>The staff have just returned. They are
quite unnerved by what they have seen;
they report nothing left of the G.P.O. but
the four outside walls and portico, so we
have lost everything. They say it is like a
burned city in France.</p>


<p class="right1"><i>May 1st, 11 a.m.</i></p>

<p>I had no time to continue this yesterday,
but during the afternoon three of the
rebel strongholds surrendered&mdash;Jacob's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Boland's, and the College of Surgeons on St.
Stephen's Green. From this last building
160 men surrendered and were marched
down Grafton Street. It is said that
among them was Countess Markievicz,
dressed in a man's uniform. It is also
said that the military made her take down
the green republican flag flying over the
building herself and replace it by a white
one: when she surrendered she took off her
bandolier and kissed it and her revolver
before handing them to the officer. She
has been one of the most dangerous of the
leaders, and I hope will be treated with
the same severity as the men. People
who saw them marched down Grafton
Street said they held themselves erect,
and looked absolutely defiant!</p>


<p class="right1"><i>2 p.m.</i></p>

<p>To-day for the first time since Easter
Monday the <i>Irish Times</i> issued a paper
with news of the rebellion. Very pluckily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
they had brought out a paper on Tuesday,
but it contained only the proclamation
and no reference to the rebellion, but a
long account of Gilbert and Sullivan's
operas which were to have been performed
this week.</p>

<p>To-day's paper bears the dates "Friday,
Saturday, and Monday, April 28th, 29th,
and May 1st"&mdash;an incident unique, I
should think, in the history of the paper.</p>

<p>It contains the various proclamations
in full, which I will cut out and send to you.
Please keep them, as they will be of
interest in the future.</p>

<p>The paper states that Sir R. Casement
is a prisoner in the Tower. So he was not
shot without trial, as we were told. It
also gives a list of the large shops and
business establishments that have been
destroyed&mdash;a total of 146.</p>

<p>It really seemed delightful to hear the
little paper boys calling their papers about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the streets again, and they had a ready sale
for their papers at three times their value.
This so encouraged them that in the
afternoon they were running about again
calling "Stop press." Several people went
out and bought papers, only to find they
were the same papers they had paid 3<i>d.</i> for
in the morning.</p>

<p>"But this is the same paper I bought
this morning."</p>

<p>"Sure, and it is, ma'am, but there's
been a power of these papers printed,
and they're not going to print any more
till they're all sold."</p>

<p>Another lady thought she would drive a
lesson home, so she said: "But you said it
was a 'Stop press,' and you knew it was not."</p>

<p>"It is, miss, but sure they hadn't time
to print the 'stop press' on it!!"</p>

<p>("Stop press" is the latest news, usually
printed on the back of the paper.)</p>

<p>Anyway, so great was the relief at seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
a paper again that no one grudged the
urchins their little harvest.</p>

<p>Yesterday H. visited the Telephone
Exchange, and a point was cleared
up that has mystified everyone; and
that is why, when the rebels on
Easter Monday took every building of
importance and every strategic position,
did they overlook the Telephone Exchange?
Had they taken it we should
have been absolutely powerless, unable to
send messages or telegrams for troops.
The exchange is situated in Crown Alley,
off Dame Street, and the superintendent
told H. an extraordinary story. It seems
when the rebels had taken the G.P.O.
they marched a detachment to take the
exchange, when just as they were turning
into Crown Alley an old woman rushed
towards them with arms held up calling
out, "Go back, boys, go back; the place is
crammed with military"; and supposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
it to be in the hands of our troops they
turned back. This was at noon. At
5 p.m. our troops arrived and took it over.</p>

<p>This saved the whole situation. Whether
the woman was on our side or whether she
thought she had seen soldiers will never
be known.</p>

<p>When at the Castle yesterday H. got
a copy of <i>The Times</i> for Saturday, the first
paper we have seen since Monday, so you
can imagine how eagerly we scanned the
news about Ireland. More has got out
than we expected, but still nothing like
the true position. We rubbed our eyes
when we read that "two battalions"
had been sent to Ireland, and wondered
if it could possibly have been a printer's
error for two divisions (40,000 men) which
actually arrived on Wednesday. The
people were in the streets of Kingstown
for twenty hours watching the troops pass
through. Since then many more troops
and artillery have come in.</p>

<p class="right1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
<i>2 p.m.</i></p>

<p>I have just returned from walking round
the G.P.O. and Sackville Street with H.
and some of the officials. It passes all my
powers of description, only one word
describes it, "Desolation." If you look
at pictures of Yprès or Louvain after the
bombardment it will give you some idea of
the scene.</p>

<p>We looked up through the windows of the
G.P.O. and saw the safe that was in H.'s
room still in the wall, and the door does
not appear to have been opened or the
safe touched, but the whole place has been
such an inferno one would think the door
must have been red-hot. Among all the
<i>débris</i> the fire was still smouldering, and
we could not penetrate inside. I picked up
a great lump of molten metal, a fantastic
shape with bits of glass embedded in
it. It is bright like silver, but they tell
me it is lead. It is quite curious. Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
realise, G., that out of all H.'s library he
now does not possess a single book, except
one volume of his Dante, and I not even a
silver teaspoon!!</p>

<p>Everything belonging to F. has gone;
as he gave his life in the war, so an act of
war has robbed us of everything belonging
to him&mdash;our most precious possession.</p>

<p>It has almost broken H. up; but he has
no time to think, which is perhaps a good
thing.</p>

<p>The old Morland and Smith mezzotints
have also gone&mdash;things we can never
replace.</p>

<p>Behind the G.P.O. was the Coliseum
Theatre, now only a shell; and on the
other side of the street was the office of
the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>, with all the printing
machinery lying among the <i>débris</i>, all
twisted and distorted; but, worst of all,
behind that was a great riding school,
where all the horses were burnt to death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
If at all possible you ought to come over
for Whitsuntide. You will see such a
sight as you will never see in your life
unless you go to Belgium.</p>

<p>When we came here H. was scandalised
at the condition of the G.P.O. The whole
frontage was given up to sorting offices,
and the public office was in a side street,
a miserable, dirty little place, that would
have been a disgrace to a small country
town.</p>

<p>H. found that plans had been drawn up
and passed for the complete reconstruction
of the interior, building in a portion
of the courtyard an office for sorting purposes,
leaving the frontage for the public
office with entrance under the great
portico.</p>

<p>So H. <i>hustled</i>, and the work was completed
and opened to the public six weeks
ago.</p>

<p>It was really beautiful. The roof was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
a large glass dome, with elaborate plaster
work, beautiful white pillars, mosaic floor,
counters all of red teak wood, and bright
brass fittings everywhere&mdash;a public building
of which any great city might be
proud; and in six weeks all that is left
is a smoking heap of ashes!</p>

<p>N. had an extraordinary find inside one
of the rooms. About six yards from the
main wall he found, covered with ashes
and a beam lying across it, a motor cycle.
It was lying on its side. He got it out
and found it perfect, tyres uninjured and
petrol in the tank, and he rode it to the
hotel, and has now taken it to the Castle
to hand over to the police.</p>


<p class="right1"><i>May 2nd, 10 a.m.</i></p>

<p>Last evening after tea I walked all
round the ruined district with N. and two
ladies from the hotel. The streets were
thronged with people, and threading their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
way among the crowd were all sorts of
vehicles: carts carrying the bodies of
dead horses that had been shot the first
day and lain in the streets ever since;
fire brigade ambulances, followed by Irish
cars bringing priests and driven by fire
brigade men. Then motors with Red
Cross emblems carrying white-jacketed
doctors would dart along, followed by a
trail of Red Cross nurses on bicycles, in
their print dresses and white overalls,
their white cap-ends floating behind them,
all speeding on their errand of mercy to
the stricken city.</p>

<p>From time to time we came across on
the unwashed pavement the large dark
stain telling its own grim story, and in one
place the blood had flowed along the pavement
for some yards and down into the
gutter; but enough of horrors. We came
sadly back, and on the steps we met Mr.
O'B. returning from a similar walk. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
could hardly speak of it, and said he stood
in Sackville Street and cried, and many
other men did the same.</p>

<p>Last night after dinner we were sitting
in the room H. uses as a temporary office
overlooking the street, when firing began
just outside. They were evidently firing
at the offices of the Sinn Fein Volunteers
at the bottom of the road. It was
probably the last stand of the rebels, and
the firing was very sharp and quick. We
thought bullets must come into the hotel.
I was reading aloud some bits out of the
<i>Daily Mail</i>, and the men were smoking.
They moved my chair back to the wall
between the windows out of the line of
fire; but the firing became so violent we
decided it was foolhardy to remain, so
we deserted the room, took our papers,
and went and sat on the stairs till it was
over.</p>

<p>Since then we have not heard a shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
fired; and it would seem that as we were
present at the first shots fired in Sackville
Street on Easter Monday so we have been
present at the last fired eight days later
in Dawson Street.</p>

<p>Out of all the novel experiences of the
last eight days two things strike me very
forcibly. The first is that, under circumstances
that might well have tried the
nerves of the strongest, there has been
no trace of fear or panic among the people
in the hotel, either among the guests or
staff. Anxiety for absent friends of whom
no tidings could be heard, though living
only in the next square, one both felt
and heard; but of fear for their own
personal safety I have seen not one trace,
and the noise of battle after the first two
days seemed to produce nothing but boredom.
The other is a total absence of thankfulness
at our own escape.</p>

<p>It may come; I don't know. Others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
may feel it; I don't. I don't pretend to
understand it; but so it is. Life as it has
been lived for the last two years in the
midst of death seems to have blunted
one's desire for it, and completely changed
one's feelings towards the Hereafter.</p>

<p>Now, G., I will end this long letter, and
my next will probably deal with normal
if less interesting matters, but intense
interest must remain in the reconstruction
of this great city.</p>

<div class="nobreak">

<p>Surely it must be possible to find men
who will rule with firmness and understanding
this fine people&mdash;so kindly, so
emotional, so clever, so easily guided,
and so magnificent when wisely led. One
prays they may be found, and found
quickly, and that we may live to see a
Dublin restored to its former stateliness
with a Government worthy of the nation.</p>

<a name="fourth" id="fourth"><span class="smcap">Fourth Letter</span></a></h2>


<p class="right1"><i>Thursday, May 4th.</i></p>

<p>Dearest G.,&mdash;I had not intended writing
again so soon, but things are still
happening that I think you will like to
know, so I am going on with this series
of letters, though I don't know when you
will get them. But as by this time you
will have seen N. you will have heard
many details from him. How much he
will have to tell his school-fellows when he
returns to Shrewsbury to-morrow! I
hoped to have sent my second and third
letters by N., and in fact had actually
packed them with his things. But when
I told H. he said the rules were so stringent
about letters that N. would certainly be
questioned as to whether he was carrying
any, and if he replied in the affirmative,
which he certainly would have done, the
letters would undoubtedly be confiscated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and N. might get into serious trouble.
So I had to unpack them again and must
keep them till the censorship is removed,
which will probably be in a few days.
They have been written under much stress
of circumstances, and are the only record we
have of this most deeply interesting time,
so I don't want to lose them altogether.</p>

<p>I am not too well, as they say here. The
loss of eight nights' sleep seems to have
robbed me of the power of sleeping for
more than an hour or two at a stretch,
and even that is attended often with horrid
dreams and nightmares. But this is only
the effect of over-strain, and no doubt
will pass, though my head feels like a
feather bed; so don't expect too much
from these later letters.</p>

<p>Last night after dinner, when H. and
I were sitting upstairs in attendance on
the telephone, who should walk in but
Dr. W. We had not met throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
rebellion, so he had heaps to tell us. His
wife and children were down at Greystones,
and the poor thing had had a
terribly anxious time, hearing nothing
reliable of her husband or of her father,
Lord S. What she did hear was that Dr.
W. had been killed and also that H. had
been shot in the G.P.O. She became so
anxious that her faithful Scotch nurse
was determined to get into Dublin and
get news or die in the attempt. I must
tell you her adventures, not only to show
you how impossible it was to get into the
city, but also it is such an extraordinary
story of endurance and devotion that
it ought to be recorded.</p>

<p>The girl started from Greystones at
2.30 p.m. on the Thursday, I think it
was, carrying for the officers' home 14 lbs.
of beef and 4 lbs. of butter, as Mrs. W.
feared supplies would have run short, since
nothing could be got in Dublin except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
at exorbitant prices (7<i>s.</i> a dozen for eggs and
14<i>s.</i> for a pair of chickens); so the girl
started carrying a dead weight of 18 lbs.</p>

<p>She walked to Bray (five miles) and took
train to Kingstown; here she had to take
to the road, as the line beyond Kingstown
was wrecked. She walked to Merrion
Gates along the tram line about four
miles, when she was stopped by sentries.
She retraced her steps as far as Merrion
Avenue (one mile), went up Merrion Avenue,
and tried the Stillorgan&ndash;Donnybrook
route. Here she got as far as Leeson
Street Bridge (six miles), when she was
within 300 yards of her destination, Dr.
W.'s house. Here again she was stopped
by sentries and turned back. She walked
back to Blackrock (seven miles), when she
was again stopped by sentries. She then
returned up Merrion Avenue and, seeing
that all routes were impossible to Dublin,
took the road to Killiney (five miles),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
where she arrived about 11.30 p.m.,
having done thirty miles. Here she got
hospitality at a cottage and stayed the
remainder of the night there, paying for
her accommodation with the 4 lbs. of
butter, but she stuck gamely to the beef.</p>

<p>Next day she walked five miles to
Shankhill, when she met a cart going to
Bray <i>viâ</i> Killiney, so she rode back to
Killiney on it and from thence to Bray.
She then walked the five miles from Bray
back to Greystones, her starting point.</p>

<p>Arrived back, she reached home absolutely
exhausted, having walked forty
miles, and dropped down saying, "There's
your beef, and I never got there or heard
anything." Mrs. W. was greatly distressed
at her having carried the meat
back when so exhausted and asked her
why she had not given it away. "And
what for should I give it away when we'll
be wanting it ourselves maybe?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Next day Dr. W. managed to get a
telephone message through to his wife
and relieved her anxiety.</p>

<p>He told us that on the first or second
night of the rebellion&mdash;he could not remember
which&mdash;two ladies of the Vigilance
Committee patrolling the streets at night
came on a soldier lying wounded in an
alley off Dawson Street, where he had
crawled on being wounded. They went
to Mercer's Hospital and gave information,
and stretcher-bearers were sent out to
bring in the man, the ladies accompanying
them. When he was on the stretcher
the two ladies walked up to the railings
of St. Stephen's Green and gave the Sinn
Feiners inside a regular dressing down,
telling them they were skunks and cowards
to shoot people down from behind bushes
and asking them why they did not come
out and fight in the open like men. Meanwhile
the stretcher-bearers had taken the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
man to the hospital, where Dr. W. saw
him.</p>

<p>"Well, my man; where are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"Divil a pellet, sorr, above the knee,"
laughing.</p>

<p>"Does it pain you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, sorr. Wait till I show
you." He pulled up his trousers and
showed five bullet shots below the knee.</p>

<p>"What regiment?"</p>

<p>"Royal Irish, sorr, like Michael Cassidy,
of Irish nationality; and I bear no ill-will
to nobody."</p>

<p>Cheery soul! His great pride was that
about forty shots had been fired at him
and not one hit him above the knee.</p>

<p>Dr. W. must bear a charmed life. He
told us of several escapes he had. One,
the most dramatic, I must tell you.</p>

<p>You know he is one of the surgeons to
Mercer's Hospital, and had to be perpetually
operating there at all hours of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
day and night, besides having his own
private hospital, in which he takes
wounded officers. It too was filled with
rebellion victims, so his work was tremendous.</p>

<p>One night he left Mercer's about 1 a.m.,
accompanied by another doctor. When
passing in front of the Shelbourne Hotel
they were challenged by our troops there.
On explaining who they were they were
of course allowed to proceed, and they
stepped briskly out, wanting to get home.
Suddenly, on the same pavement, about
twenty yards away as far as they could
judge in the black darkness, out flashed
two little lights from small electric lamps,
evidently Sinn Fein signals. Dr. W.
stopped and said to his companion: "Did
you see that? it was a signal," when
almost before the words were out of his
mouth two rifles blazed straight at them,
almost blinding them with the flash, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
they <i>felt</i> the bullets whiz past their heads.
The two Sinn Feiners, having signalled,
waited long enough to see if their signal
was returned, and then fired straight at
where by their footsteps they supposed
Dr. W. and his friend to be, and missed
them by an inch or two.</p>

<p>Dr. W. and his friend got into the shelter
of a doorway and flattened themselves
out, trying to look as if they were not
there, and quite forgetting that they both
had lighted cigarettes, whose red tips
should have been a beacon light to a vital
spot had the Sinn Feiners noticed them.
But for some reason they did not proceed
further, and Dr. W. heard their steps
dying away in the distance. Meanwhile
his companion had his finger on the electric
bell of the doorway where they were
hiding, and after a time which seemed like
an eternity an upper window opened and
a voice inquired who was there, whereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the woman of the house came down and
let them in, and they spent the remainder
of the night there.</p>

<p>Yesterday the Post Office was able to
pay the separation allowances to the
soldiers' wives. Last week of course it
was impossible, but as it would have been
equally impossible for them to have
bought anything it did not so much
matter. The question was how to get so
large a sum of money round to the outlying
post offices in safety, for, though
the city is now comparatively safe, there
are still snipers in outlying districts, and
any party of Post Office officials known
to have possession of large sums of money
would undoubtedly have been attacked.
So H. bethought him to requisition for
one of the boiler armoured cars with
military guard, and it was at once granted
him. We had heard of them from N.,
but had not seen one, and great was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
excitement at the hotel when this huge
monster arrived for H.'s instructions. We
all went out and examined it.</p>

<p>It was not one of Guinness's, but one that
had been rigged up by one of the railway
companies, with an engine boiler fixed on
to a huge motor trolley, all painted light
grey; and all down each side were black
dots in an elegant design&mdash;something like
this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_098.jpg" width="400" height="121" alt="Black dots down each side in an elegant design" />
</div>

<p>Here and there one of these squares was
cut out and acted as an air-hole, but they
all looked exactly alike, so a sniper on a
roof or from a window aiming at one of
these squares probably found his bullet
struck iron and bounded off to the accompaniment
of derisive jeers from the
"Tommies" inside.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_099.jpg" width="500" height="367" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Armoured Car.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
From the hotel the car proceeded to the
Bank of Ireland, and took over £10,000
in <i>silver</i>, and started on its round to all
the post offices, delivering the money in
perfect safety. I will try and send you a
photograph of one of these most ingenious
conveyances.</p>

<p>After it had started on its round I went
with H. to see the temporary sorting offices.
H. had secured an enormous skating rink
at the back of the Rotunda, and here all
the sorting of letters was going on, with
no apparatus whatever except what the
men had contrived for themselves out of
seats, benches and old scenery. They were
all hard at work&mdash;a regular hive of bees.
We think it is greatly to the credit of the
Post Office staff that in twelve days from
the <i>outbreak</i> of the rebellion and three
days after the actual cessation of hostilities
the whole service was reorganised, with
two deliveries a day in Dublin, besides the
ordinary country and mail deliveries. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
engineers and telegraphists were no less
wonderful. Indeed the staff from top to
bottom of the office have worked splendidly,
and H. is very proud of them. We
looked in at the poor G.P.O. on our way
back. It is still smouldering, and it will be
quite a fortnight before any excavations
can be begun, but H. hopes to get the safe
that contains many of our treasures out of
the wall and opened in a few days.</p>

<p>To-day a Dr. C. who is staying in the
hotel told me of an extraordinary escape
he had had during one of the days of the
rebellion. He was walking through one
of the squares, which he had been told
was clear of snipers, with an old friend
of about eighty, when suddenly a bullet
struck the pavement at the feet of his
friend and ricochetted off. It was within
an inch of the old gentleman's feet, and
he was greatly interested, wanting to find
the bullet to keep as a memento. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
they were looking about for it a man who
had been walking just behind them passed
them on the pavement, and had only gone
a few yards when they heard a second
rifle shot, and the man dropped like a stone,
shot through the heart. Dr. C. ran up to
him, but he was quite dead. There was
absolutely no safety anywhere from the
snipers; man, woman, or child, nothing
came amiss to them. It was dastardly
fighting, if it could be called fighting at
all.</p>

<p>A few days after St. Stephen's Green was
supposed to have been cleared of rebels,
we were told of a young woman whose
husband was home from the war wounded
and in one of the hospitals. She was going
to see him, so took a short cut through
the Green, when she was shot through the
thigh; it is supposed by a rebel, in hiding
in the shrubberies.</p>

<p class="right1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
<i>Sunday, 7th.</i></p>

<p>I am sending off my other letters to you
to-morrow, as we hear the censorship is
no longer so strict, and as from the papers
the position here seems now to be known in
England private letters are not likely to
be stopped. I will keep this till the safe
is opened and tell you the result.</p>


<p class="right1"><i>15th.</i></p>

<p>To-day Mr. O'B. brought his wife to
see me, and they have offered us their
lovely house, Celbridge Abbey, about ten
miles from Dublin, for five or six weeks
from June 1st as they are going abroad
again, and they thought we should like
it for a change. We are more than grateful,
as all our plans for going to Greystones
for June and July are knocked on the
head; but to Celbridge there is a good
train service, and H. can come into
Dublin every day, while I can revel in
the lovely garden and grounds and recover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in the peace and quiet my lost powers of
sleep. What a kind thought it is, and
how welcome at such a time! Celbridge
Abbey was the home of Swift's "Vanessa,"
and later of Grattan, Ireland's greatest
orator, so is a most interesting and historical
place.</p>


<p class="right1"><i>17th.</i></p>

<p>To-day the safe was opened, and contained
nothing of any value,&mdash;only a
few official papers!</p>

<p>With this has gone our last hope of any
salvage from the wreck of our property.
Dillon's "perfect gentlemen," of whom he
expressed himself so proud in the House
the other night, had evidently broken open
H.'s great official desk, and found the key
of the safe and abstracted my jewel-case,
F.'s field-glasses and several other of his
much-prized possessions, and then locked
the safe again. The only document they
stole from among the official documents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
was F.'s commission. Why, we cannot
imagine, unless the fact that it bore the
King's signature made it worthy of special
insult and desecration.</p>

<p>H. was very sad when he told me, but
I think I am past caring about any possessions
now. F. and all his precious
things are gone. Nothing else seems worth
considering. Perhaps some day we may
pluck up heart to collect things again
around us, but at present one can only
feel, "Let the dead bury the dead."</p>


<p class="right1"><i>20th.</i></p>

<p>To-day they are beginning on the excavations
of H.'s room; the fire burnt with
such ferocity that there is much less rubble
in it than one would imagine. As you
probably remember, H.'s room was on the
first floor, with a storey above it. When
the whole place fell in, H.'s room fell
through into the room below, and a portion
of that had fallen through to the cellars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
The men are removing everything of the
nature of bricks and iron and stone coping
of the roof, and then four extra-careful
men are to be put on to shovel up the rest
of the <i>débris</i>, which is burnt to powder,
and Noblett, H.'s confidential messenger,
is going to be there to receive anything of
ours that may be found.</p>


<p class="right1"><i>23rd.</i></p>

<p>Yesterday morning and this morning
I have been down watching the excavations
of H.'s room. It is quite like the
excavations at Pompeii. Every shovelful
is most carefully overlooked, and several
of our things have turned up, though so
far nothing of any intrinsic value. When
I went there yesterday morning Noblett
produced a great lump of molten glass of
no shape or form with one or two metal
nobs sticking up at odd angles. He thought
it was the remains of a cruet, but we had
none; and on further examination it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
flashed across my mind that it was the
cut-glass bottles in the large rosewood
and brass-bound dressing-case in which
I had packed all my jewellery&mdash;family
miniatures, four gold watches and chains,
diamond pendant, etc. It had been stolen
out of the safe, and evidently the looters
had not been able to get it away. Noblett
was thrilled, and the men redoubled their
carefulness, hoping to find some of the
jewellery. When I went down again in
the afternoon Noblett produced three little
brooches that F. had given me on various
birthdays when a wee boy. He always
went out with his own sixpence, and
nearly always returned with a brooch,
which I used to wear with great pride. One,
a Swastika brooch, he gave me when he
was at Margate after that terrible illness,
and he used to go on the pier in his bath-chair.
The blue enamel on it was intact
in several places; the other two were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
intact in form, but charred and black,
with the pins burnt off. But how glad I
was to see them again! During the afternoon
two or three more brooches turned
up, but nothing of any value whatever.
So we came to the conclusion the rebels had
broken open the box and taken out everything
of value and thrown away the rest.
The few burnt bits of jewellery that were
found all came from one spot.</p>

<p>This morning when I went Noblett had
nearly a sackful of curiosities, which I
sorted over. Evidently these were the
whole contents of the canteen of plated
things we used to take with us when we
took a furnished house and put the silver
in a bank, quantities of spoons and forks,
black, and looking like old iron, many
twisted into weird shapes, and the knives,
which were new when we came here,
without a scrap of ivory handle, and the
blades burnt and twisted in the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
extraordinary way. A most miserable-looking
collection, fit only for the dust-heap.</p>


<p class="right1"><i>25th.</i></p>

<p>They are nearing the end of the excavations,
and nothing of any value has been
found. This morning when I went I found
them cutting into a mound of what looked
like solid white chalk. I could not imagine
what it could be, but the men told me it was
the books that had been stored in one of
the great mahogany presses; not a trace
of burnt wood was found. I could not
believe that books could be reduced to
such a substance. I had expected to find
quantities of charred black paper, with
possibly some fragments of binding, and
was quite incredulous. However, on
examining it I found the substance was
in layers like the leaves of a book, but
when I picked some up it felt like silk
between my fingers, and you could blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
it away like thistle-down. Had I not
seen it myself I should never have believed
such a thing possible. Besides H.'s and
P.'s books there were a number of great
official books in leather bindings half
an inch thick, but <i>all</i> was reduced to the
same substance.</p>

<p>Noblett gave me to-day one of Princess
Mary's gift boxes that had been sent to
me by a soldier at the front; except for
being black instead of bright brass, it was
absolutely uninjured&mdash;the medallion in
the centre, and the inscription, date, etc.,
perfect. The Christmas card inside and
the Queen's letter were just black charred
paper, but you could see the M. and the
crown above it on the card. Also an
antique brass snuff-box inlaid with mother-of-pearl
turned up but little injured.</p>


<p class="right1"><i>26th.</i></p>

<p>To-day the men finished their work on
H.'s room. At the last about eight frag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>ments
of silver forks and two tablespoons
were taken out and a foot of a silver
sugar-bowl with a bit of something that
looked like burnt tissue paper attached
to it; and that was all that was found
of all our silver. The half of a copper
base of one of our beautiful Sheffield plate
candelabra came out of one of the last
shovelfuls,&mdash;and there was an end of all
our property.</p>


<div class="nobreak">

<p>So that page is turned, and it seems a
good place to end this over-long letter.
On Thursday we go down to Celbridge,
where with memories of Swift and the
wretched and foolish Vanessa and in
company with a beautiful swan and
swaness, which bring their babies to the
lawn to be admired and duly fed, I am

Nationhood, <span class="smcap">Ireland</span>, through us, summons
her Children to her flag and strikes
for her freedom.</p>

<p>Having organised and trained her manhood

the Irish Volunteers and the Irish
Citizen Army, having patiently perfected
her discipline, having resolutely waited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
for the right moment to reveal itself, she
now seizes that moment, and, supported

<p><span class="smcap">We declare</span> the right of the people of
Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and
to the unfettered control of Irish destinies,
to be sovereign and indefeasible. The long
usurpation of that right by a foreign
people and Government has not extinguished
the right, nor can it ever be extinguished
except by the destruction of the
Irish people. In every generation the
Irish people have asserted their right to
national freedom and sovereignty; six
times during the past three hundred years
they have asserted it in arms. Standing
on that fundamental right and again
asserting it in arms in the face of the
world, we hereby proclaim the Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Republic as a Sovereign Independent
State, and we pledge our lives and the lives
of our comrades-in-arms to the cause of
its freedom, of its welfare, and of its
exaltation among the nations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Irish Republic</span> is entitled to, and
<span class="smcap">HEREBY CLAIMS</span>, the allegiance of every
Irishman and Irishwoman. The Republic
guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal
rights and equal opportunities to all its
citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue
the happiness and prosperity of the whole
nation and of all its parts, cherishing all
the children of the Nation equally, and
oblivious of the differences carefully fostered
by an Alien Government, which
have divided a minority from the majority
in the past.</p>

<p>Until our arms have brought the opportune
moment for the establishment of a
permanent National Government, representative
of the whole people of Ireland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and elected by the suffrages of all her
men and women, the Provisional Government
hereby constituted, will administer
the civil and military affairs of the Republic
in trust for the people.</p>

<p>We place the cause of the Irish Republic
under the protection of the Most High
God, Whose blessing we invoke upon our
arms, and we pray that no one who serves
that cause will dishonour it by cowardice,
inhumanity, or rapine. In this supreme
hour the Irish Nation must, by its valour
and discipline and by the readiness of
its children to sacrifice themselves for the
common good, prove itself worthy of the
august destiny to which it is called.</p>

REBEL HEADQUARTERS,
GENERAL POST OFFICE.</a></h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Headquarters Army of the Irish
Republic.</span></p>

<p class="right2 mb0">General Post Office, Dublin.</p>
<p class="right1 mt0">28th April 1916&mdash;9.30 a.m.</p>

<p>The Forces of the Irish Republic, which
was proclaimed in Dublin on Easter
Monday 24th April, have been in possession
of the central part of the Capital since 12
noon on that day. Up to yesterday afternoon
Headquarters was in touch with all
the main outlying positions, and despite
furious and almost continuous assaults
by the British Forces all those positions
were then still being held, and the Commandants
in charge were confident of
their ability to hold them for a long time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>During the course of yesterday afternoon
and evening the enemy succeeded in cutting
our communications with our other positions
in the city, and Headquarters is
to-day isolated.</p>

<p>The enemy has burnt down whole blocks
of houses, apparently with the object of
giving themselves a clear field for the play
of artillery and field guns against us.</p>

<p>We have been bombarded during the
evening and night by shrapnel and
machine-gun fire, but without material
damage to our position, which is of great
strength.</p>

<p>We are busy completing arrangements
for the final defence of Headquarters and
are determined to hold it while the buildings
last.</p>

<p>I desire now, lest I may not have an
opportunity later, to pay homage to the
gallantry of the soldiers of Irish Freedom
who have during the past four days been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
writing with fire and steel the most
glorious chapter in the later history of
Ireland. Justice can never be done to
their heroism, to their discipline, to their
gay and unconquerable spirit in the midst
of peril and death.</p>

<p>Let me, who have led them into this,
speak in my own, and in my fellow Commanders'
names, and in the name of Ireland
present and to come, their praises,
and ask those who come after them to
remember them.</p>

<p>For four days they have fought and
toiled, almost without cessation, almost
without sleep; and in the intervals of
fighting they have sung songs of the freedom
of Ireland.</p>

<p>No man has complained, no man has
asked "Why?" Each individual has
spent himself, happy to pour out his
strength for Ireland and for freedom. If
they do not win this fight, they will at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
have deserved to win it. But win it they
will, although they may win it in death.
Already they have won a great thing.
They have redeemed Dublin from many
shames, and made her name splendid
among the names of cities.</p>

<p>If I were to mention names of individuals
my list would be a long one. I will name
only that of Commandant General James
Connolly, commanding the Dublin division.
He is wounded, but is still the guiding brain
of our resistance.</p>

<p>If we accomplish no more than we have
accomplished, I am satisfied. I am satisfied
that we have saved Ireland's honour.
I am satisfied that we should have accomplished
more, that we should have accomplished
the task of enthroning, as well as
proclaiming the Irish Republic as a Sovereign
State, had our arrangements for a
simultaneous rising of the whole country,
with a combined plan as sound as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Dublin plan has been proved to be, been
allowed to go through on Easter Sunday.
Of the fatal countermanding order which
prevented those plans from being carried
out, I shall not speak further. Both
Eoin MacNeill and we have acted in the
best interests of Ireland.</p>

<p>For my part, as to anything I have done
in this, I am not afraid to face either
the judgment of God, or the judgment of
posterity.</p>
